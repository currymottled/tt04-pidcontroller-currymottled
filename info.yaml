# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

    how_it_works: |
        It's a PID control block to be set with I2C. GPIOs 7 through 2 are for error input and control output, GPIOs 1 and 0 and for SDA and SCL.
    how_to_test:  |
	The I2C 'addresses' are written in the I2C_config_param.v subfiles (e.g. in the slave). The main I2C testbench has an example for what to send to configure PID constants.
